# GeekLabs-TD

GeekLabs-TD is a **fun-to-play tower defense game** developed as part of the GeekLabs sandbox.

The current focus is **gameplay and mechanics**, not graphics or visual polish.

## Project Vision

GeekLabs-TD exists as a mechanics-first tower defense project where ideas can be tested, refined, and iterated quickly. The goal is to build a tower defense experience that feels good to play before investing time into art, animation, or presentation.

## Design Priorities

- Responsive and satisfying core gameplay
- Clear, readable mechanics
- Depth through systems rather than visuals
- Fast iteration and experimentation

Graphics are intentionally minimal at this stage so development effort can focus on balance, pacing, player decision-making, and replayability.

## Current Features

- Grid-based tower placement
- Path-based enemy movement
- Automatic tower targeting and firing
- Deterministic projectile system (no physics instability)
- Tower upgrades (Tier 1–3)

## Tech Stack

- Phaser 3
- Vite
- JavaScript
- Static deployment via Nginx

## Development Philosophy

GeekLabs-TD is a laboratory project:
- Mechanics first
- Visual polish later
- Small, controlled changes
- Frequent testing
- Easy to deploy and share builds for feedback

Once the gameplay foundation is solid, visual style, effects, audio, and UI polish will be layered in deliberately.
